# AI Onboarding

This project uses three MCP servers as the default AI context layer for day-to-day development:

- **Figma MCP** for design files, components, variables, and layout context
- **Context7 MCP** for current, version-aware library documentation and examples
- **GitHub MCP** for repository, issue, pull request, and workflow access

These MCPs are **developer-tool integrations**, not runtime dependencies of the Next.js app.

## Repository-Shared MCP Config

This repository now includes project-scoped MCP config for the three main clients we use:

- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Claude Code**: `.mcp.json`
- **Codex**: `.codex/config.toml` in trusted projects

These committed files share the **server definitions**, but they do **not** store secrets.
For Codex, open this repository as a trusted project before running project-specific MCP commands, otherwise Codex may fall back to user-level MCP config.

## Per-User Authentication Model

### Figma MCP

- No API key is committed in this repo.
- This project uses the **desktop MCP server**, which runs locally at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`.
- Each developer must:
  - install and run the Figma desktop app
  - enable the desktop MCP server in Dev Mode
  - sign in with their own Figma account
  - have permission to the Figma files they want to inspect

### Context7 MCP

- This repo uses the **OAuth endpoint**: `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth`.
- That avoids committing a shared API key.
- Each developer authenticates interactively inside their client after the server is added.
- If a client does not support MCP OAuth, Context7 documents API key auth as the fallback.

### GitHub MCP

- This repo uses GitHub's hosted remote MCP server.
- **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, and **Codex** use a per-user `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT`.
- In Claude Code, if `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` is missing, GitHub may show `Failed to connect` or return `401` while the other project MCP servers still load.
- We do **not** share one PAT across the team.
- Access stays tied to the developer's own GitHub identity and token scopes.

## What We Use Each MCP For

### Figma MCP

**What it is**

Figma's official MCP server gives AI agents access to design context from Figma files, including frames, components, variables, layout information, Make resources, and Code Connect context.

**Why we want it here**

- Implement QF views against real designs instead of approximations
- Pull design tokens and layout data from the source of truth
- Keep generated UI closer to the design system

**Project choice**

- We use the **desktop** Figma MCP server, not the hosted Figma MCP server.
- Shared repo config points to `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`.

**Official docs**

- [Figma MCP Server introduction](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/)
- [Desktop server installation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/)
- [Plans, access, and permissions](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/plans-access-and-permissions/)
- [Figma MCP Catalog](https://www.figma.com/mcp-catalog/)

**Client setup links**

- Claude Code: [Figma desktop server docs, Claude Code section](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/#claude-code)
- Codex: [OpenAI Codex MCP docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) plus [Figma desktop server installation](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/)

Inference from the official docs:

- Figma does not currently publish a dedicated **desktop-server** guide for Codex. For Codex, we use the generic project-scoped MCP config supported by OpenAI Codex together with Figma's local desktop endpoint.

### Context7 MCP

**What it is**

Context7 is an MCP server for up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples pulled directly from source docs and repositories.

**Why we want it here**

- This repo depends on fast-moving tools where stale examples are expensive
- It is useful for Next.js, React, GraphQL, TanStack Query, Thirdweb, Viem, Tailwind, Vitest, and Playwright
- It gives agents a safer default path for API verification before they suggest changes

**Project choice**

- We use the **OAuth** endpoint in shared config: `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth`
- That keeps Context7 credentials out of version control
- In Codex, open and trust this repo first, then run `codex mcp get context7` and confirm the URL is `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth`
- After that check, authenticate it with `codex mcp login context7`

**Official docs**

- [Context7 overview](https://context7.com/docs/overview)
- [Context7 installation](https://context7.com/docs/installation)
- [Context7 OAuth](https://context7.com/docs/howto/oauth)
- [Adding libraries to Context7](https://context7.com/docs/adding-libraries)

**Client setup links**

- Cursor: [Context7 Cursor setup](https://context7.com/docs/clients/cursor)
- Claude Code: [Context7 Claude Code setup](https://context7.com/docs/clients/claude-code)
- Codex: [OpenAI Codex MCP docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) plus [Context7 all clients](https://context7.com/docs/resources/all-clients) and [Context7 OAuth](https://context7.com/docs/howto/oauth)

Inference from the official docs and local verification:

- Context7's published Codex example currently shows the API-key variant using `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` and `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`.
- This repo intentionally uses Context7's OAuth endpoint instead, because current Codex supports MCP OAuth and can authenticate it with `codex mcp login context7`.

### GitHub MCP

**What it is**

GitHub's official MCP server connects AI tools directly to GitHub for repository browsing, code access, issues, pull requests, workflows, releases, and other platform data.

**Why we want it here**

- Inspect PRs, issues, and workflow runs without leaving the coding flow
- Work with remote repository state that local git history does not fully cover
- Support review and triage tasks that need live GitHub context

**Project choice**

- We use GitHub's hosted remote server
- Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex reference a per-user `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT`
- In Claude Code, the shared `.mcp.json` uses `${GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT:-}` so a missing PAT does not break the rest of the project-scoped config

## Shared Config Files In This Repo

### `.cursor/mcp.json`

- Provides project-scoped config for Cursor
- Uses `figma-desktop`, `context7`, and `github`
- Uses `${env:GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT}` for GitHub auth

### `.mcp.json`

- Provides project-scoped config for Claude Code
- Uses explicit `type: "http"` entries, matching Claude Code's current project config format
- Uses the hosted GitHub MCP URL with an `Authorization` header built from `${GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT:-}`
- The `:-` default avoids breaking `.mcp.json` parsing when `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` is unset
- If `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` is not set, GitHub may appear as `Failed to connect` in Claude Code while Figma and Context7 still load

### `.codex/config.toml`

- Provides project-scoped config for Codex
- Applies in trusted projects
- Uses `figma-desktop`, `context7`, and `github`
- Uses the Context7 OAuth endpoint
- Before authenticating Context7, run `codex mcp get context7` in this repo and confirm it resolves to `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth`
- If `codex mcp get context7` resolves to `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`, Codex is still using a user-level Context7 server and the project config is not active yet
- Once the project config is active, authenticate Context7 with `codex mcp login context7`
- Uses `bearer_token_env_var = "GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT"` for GitHub auth

## Setting Up `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` for Terminal and Desktop Apps

On macOS, GUI apps (Claude, Codex, Cursor) do **not** read shell config files like `~/.zshenv`. You need to set the env var in two places.

### 1. Terminal apps (shell)

Add this to `~/.zshenv`:

```bash
export GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT='github_pat_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
```

This covers Claude Code CLI and any terminal-based tool.

### 2. Desktop / GUI apps (launchctl)

macOS GUI apps inherit environment from `launchd`, not from your shell. To make the variable visible to Claude, Codex, and Cursor desktop apps, add this line to `~/.zshenv` **after** the export:

```bash
launchctl setenv GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT "$GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT"
```

Your `~/.zshenv` should look like:

```bash
export GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT='github_pat_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
launchctl setenv GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT "$GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT"
```

### Verifying

- **Terminal**: `echo $GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT`
- **GUI apps**: `launchctl getenv GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT`

Both should print your token.

### Important notes

- `launchctl setenv` does **not** persist across reboots on its own — that's why you put it in `~/.zshenv`, so it re-runs on every login shell start.
- After setting or changing the value, **restart** any already-running desktop apps (Claude, Codex, Cursor) for them to pick up the new value.
- Do **not** wrap the token in `$(echo ...)` — pass it as a plain string or use `"$VARIABLE"` expansion.

## Verification Checklist

After pulling the repo config, each developer should verify:

1. **Figma**: the desktop app is running and the desktop MCP server is enabled in Dev Mode
2. **Context7**: in Codex, open and trust this repo, run `codex mcp get context7`, confirm the URL is `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth`, then run `codex mcp login context7`; in other clients, authenticate after the OAuth endpoint appears
3. **GitHub**: `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` is available in Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex
4. **Cursor**: the servers appear in the MCP settings and show as connected
5. **Claude Code**: run `claude mcp list`; if GitHub shows `Failed to connect`, confirm `GIVETH_GITHUB_MCP_PAT` is set in the Claude Code environment
6. **Codex**: start Codex in this repository, verify the project-scoped MCP servers are available from MCP settings, and confirm Context7 is logged in against the project-scoped `/oauth` server
