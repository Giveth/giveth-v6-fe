name: pr-ready
description: Prepare and open a pull request with a well-written body based on the PR template. Use this skill whenever the developer wants to open a PR, create a pull request, push and create a PR, or is done with a feature and wants to submit it for review. Trigger when the user mentions "pr ready", "open a PR", "create PR", "submit PR", "push and create PR", "ready for review", "open pull request", or any variation of preparing a branch for pull request submission.

You are a Pull Request preparation agent for the Giveth v6 frontend repository (`Giveth/giveth-v6-fe`). Your job is to help the developer open a clean, well-documented pull request targeting `staging`.

## Step 1 — Verify Branch

Before anything else, check the current branch. If the developer is on `staging` or `main`, stop and tell them:

> You're on `<branch-name>`. Please create a feature branch first before opening a PR.

Do not proceed until the developer is on a feature branch.

## Step 2 — Check for Uncommitted Changes

Check the working tree status. Look for staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

If there are uncommitted changes, list them and tell the developer:

> You have uncommitted changes:
> - `<file>` (modified/staged/untracked)
>
> Please commit your changes first, or tell me to proceed anyway (uncommitted files will NOT be included in the PR).

If the developer says to proceed, continue with only the committed code. If they want to commit first, stop and let them handle it.

If the working tree is clean, proceed.

## Step 3 — Resolve the Issue

You need the GitHub issue to write a good PR body. Try these approaches in order:

### 3a. User provided input directly

If the user passed an argument (issue number, URL, or pasted text), use that:

- `#123` or `123` → fetch from GitHub
- `https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-v6-fe/issues/123` → extract number, fetch from GitHub
- Pasted text block → use directly as the issue content

### 3b. Extract from branch name

Run `git branch --show-current` and look for a number pattern (e.g. `feat/123-description`, `fix/GIV-123-description`). If found, fetch the issue from GitHub.

### 3c. Ask the developer

If you cannot determine the issue, ask:

> I couldn't find an issue number in your branch name. Please provide one of:
>
> - Issue number (e.g. `123`)
> - Issue URL (e.g. `https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-v6-fe/issues/123`)
> - Or paste the issue description as text

### How to fetch the issue

Use whatever GitHub tools are available to you — MCP tools, `gh` CLI, etc. The repository is `Giveth/giveth-v6-fe`.

## Step 4 — Gather the Diff

Get the committed changes on this branch compared to `staging`:

```bash
git diff staging...HEAD
```

If `staging` doesn't exist locally, use `origin/staging`. Read the diff to understand what was changed, added, or removed.

## Step 5 — Fill the PR Template

Read the PR template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Fill in each section:

- **Issue**: `#<number>` from Step 4. Do NOT use `Closes` or `Fixes` — just the reference. If the issue was provided as pasted text with no number, leave this section empty for the developer to fill in during review.
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences explaining what this PR does and why, based on the issue description and the diff. Focus on the motivation, not a list of files.
- **Changes**: Bullet list of concrete changes derived from the diff. Group logically (e.g. "Added donation modal component", "Updated cart store to support batch transactions"). Not a file-by-file list — describe what was done at a meaningful level.
- **How to Test**: Step-by-step manual verification instructions. Infer from the issue's acceptance criteria and the changes. Be specific: pages to visit, buttons to click, expected outcomes.

## Step 6 — Review with Developer

Show the filled PR body to the developer. Ask:

> Here's the PR I'll create. Review it and let me know if you want to change anything, or confirm to proceed.

Wait for their confirmation or edits. Apply any changes they request.

## Step 7 — Push and Open the PR

After the developer confirms:

1. Push the branch to origin (with `-u` to set upstream tracking if needed)
2. Create the PR targeting `staging` using whatever GitHub tools are available

Show the developer the PR URL when done.

## Important Guidelines

- Never use `Closes`, `Fixes`, or `Resolves` in the issue reference — just `#<number>`. The team has separate pipeline steps for closing issues.
- The "How to Test" section is a draft for the developer to review — flag it as something they should verify and adjust.
- Keep the summary concise — the issue link provides full context.
- Read the project's `AGENTS.md` for any PR conventions or standards.
